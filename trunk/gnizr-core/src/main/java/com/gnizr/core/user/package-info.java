/**
 * Provides classes for managing and querying information about <code>User</code>. Classes in this 
 * package implement the business logic of user-related operations, buliding on
 * the DAO classes in the Database Package. Typical client programs should use classes in this package 
 * and not those in the Databaes Package.
