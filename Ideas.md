# Introduction #

This page describes new features that may be considered in the future gnizr development. There is no guarantee that any of these features will actually be implemented. Users are encouraged to discuss these ideas in [the gnizr user group](http://groups.google.com/group/gnizr-users).

### Suggest Related Search Terms ###

On the search result page, gnizr will suggest related search terms that could be of interests to the users. For example, when search for "programming", the user may receive search suggestions: "java", "maven", "webwork".

Tag relations defined by the users can be used to facilitate search term suggestion. For example, gnizr recommends "java", "maven" and "webwork" because some user (e.g. the superuser 'gnizr') has defined those terms to be SKOS related to "programming".

### Gnizr News Channel ###

Users can create news channels from bookmarks saved in the gnizr community. When a new channel is created, it will have its widget space in the user's New Channel page. The layout of the News Channel page is similar to which of the My Yahoo! page.

News Channels are created by defining keywords. Keywords are the strings to match in the tag space or the text of the bookmarks.

A user can define 1 to N news channels. The News Channel page will have two columns: Main and Side. When a new channel is displayed in the Main column, the bookmarks will be display a blog-style layout -- title, body text and footer etc. When a new channel is displayed in the Side column, only title and some key meta-data is displayed.

By default, all news channels are displayed in the Side column and except one of those is displayed in the Main column. Users can switch channels in the Side column to be displayed in the Main column by clicking on the title of the news channel.
