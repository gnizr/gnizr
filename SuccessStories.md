# Success Stories #

Dr. Harry Chen says:

> Gnizr is an excellent tool for education. When teaching the [Social Web Technologies](http://socialwebtechnologies.blogspot.com) course, I installed a copy of gnizr behind the [eBiquity Research Group](http://ebiquity.umbc.edu)'s firewall and used the software to share bookmarks with students in the class.

> I also used gnizr in a [group programming project](http://groups.google.com/group/umbc-cmsc-socialwebtech-class/web/group-project-home) to teach students Web application development and open source project management. The process of hacking gnizr code and its underlying technologies -- WebWork, Freemarker, Spring, XML and Maven, has given students the opportunity to experiment with the  real-world software development process and team collaboration.

> Web application development is a complex process. Without using an open source software like gnizr, it will be difficult to develop a hands-on Computer Science project that prepares students for their real-world challenges. Furthermore, because gnizr is free and open source, students with some innovation and luck maybe able to turn out the next "killer" social web application, like Facebook and Del.icio.us.
